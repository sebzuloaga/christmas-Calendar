                You are a man with fine taste, and I wish that I was able to help out
                get all those fancy things things that are on your list. Though I might
                not be able to help you out with a lot of money, I would like to gift 
                you 4 lotto tickets hoping that they might get you closer to crossing out 
                some of the things on your list!
